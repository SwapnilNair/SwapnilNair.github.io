My personal website
Was supposed to study physics currently,but this brought back memories.
Wonder if I can get to the point where I can get my own website as cool as GarySheng or Brandon Johnson(which is an absolute masterpiece).
Note to future self: Dont make it crappy coloured, use black white grey and green please.
